Upgrade your WordPress to the latest release the most easiest way possible!

== Description ==

Don't have access to your hosting provider so you can do subversion update? Or your hosting doesn't have subversion installed. Well, this is where my plug-in comes in!

SVN upgrade uses database (wp_svn table) in which it stores the latest repository revision. If a new revision is out, you can do the upgrade, otherwise it will tell you that it is on the latest version.


== Installation ==

1. Upload wp-svn directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set the repository and the username and password in the Settings menu (or leave default for the default WordPress repository)
4. It is smart to backup everything, should something  go wrong.
